# Welcome!
Iâ€™m a Ph.D. student in economics at the [University of Maryland](https://www.umd.edu/). Prior to Maryland, I studied economics and mathematics at [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/). My research interests fall in political economy and labor economics, with focus on issues about China.
